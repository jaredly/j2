Ok so I'm thinking about incremental language things,
as a result of my conversation with rtfeldman.
and ... I wonder if macros are the answer.

Specifically, my approach to macros, where the macro-expansion
is what is saved.

So, you're bumping along, with all the guardrails on, and then you need
to customize something.
So you *turn one of the macros off*, meaning it's no longer hiding the impl,
you get to muck with it directly.
hmmmmm
