# Fixtures

So there's
- input / output:expected / output:failed

# Expect Tests

Values
and
Types

Should all tests go in the same ~file?

or should I have 'fixture tests' and 'expect tests'?

fixture tests certainly are more fragile
probably a good idea to bias toward expect tests.

btw can also do `expect:equals` and stuff once I have a runtime.
