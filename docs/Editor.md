so, thinking about the little editor dealio

I have a series of toplevels
editing one toplevel is distinct from the others
if you start editing one, and it turns out you're making a new toplevel, then it splits you off?
Or ... just when you 'escape' does it split things up ...
how about execution?
you only need to re-execute
