oooooh ok so antelang takes `k` and just makes it a keyword! Honestly that has some appeal.
```
handle_give_int (f: unit -> a with GiveInt) -> a =
    handle f ()
    | give_int str ->
        if str == "zero"
        then resume 0
        else resume 123
```


With fresh eyes & the new plan for records & enums:



```
effect State<T> {
	`Get => T,
	`Set(T) => (),
}

type State:Effect = <T>[ `Get | `Set(T) ]
type State:Full = <T, Final>[ State:Effect<T> | `Final(Final)]

let rec loop = (current, fn) => {
	switch handle!(fn) {
		`Get => resume!(current),
		`Set(value) => loop(value, () => resume!()),
		`Final(value) => value,
	}
}

// mensch I would just love to be able to unify effects
// with enums.

// eh I wonder if I should give effects a rest for a minute?
// erg but then we'd run the monad gauntlet. no ways.

// ok I guess we probably need effectvbls and effect tracking
// to exist separate from type vbls. ðŸ¤”. There are different rules
// between them, after all.

// waiiiiiit ok so hm if enums are .. anonymous now,
// are effects as well? like structural?
let rec loop = (current, fn) => {

	// yeah, so if handle! were to return some value.
	`Final(value) make sense.
	but the rest of it doesn't really.

	// when providing multiple ... effects here,
	// how do we distinguish which one gets lopped off?
	// calling handle!{# one, two, three #}
	// would it really just be the first that is plucked?
	// I guess the ... syntax makes that something to expect

	handle! : <Result>{# Efff, ...e #}(someFn: () ={Efff, e}> Result) ={e}> [
		`Final(Result),
		`Effect(Efff)
	]

	switch handle!(fn) {
		`Effect(`Get, k) => k(current),
		// nooo because the type of K dependson the type of the effect.
		`Get => resume!(current),
		`Set(value) => loop(value, () => resume!()),
		`Final(value) => value,
	}
}

<T>[# `Get => T | `Set(T) => () #]

and ... if I claim to handle just `[# `Get => T #]`, what does that mean?
It means I don't get it at all, right?

Hm so like I'd need to fully resolve out the effect definition,
and then probably hash it? Seems like that would do the trick.
oh hm wait.
what about effect polymorphism.
Am I hoping that ... monomorphising everything will fix that too?
I guess it'll have to.

```













Soooo
```ts

effect State<T> {
	Get{} => T,
	Set{value: T} => (),
}

// -> produces (essentially? Maybe literally?)
enum State:Effect<T> {
	Get{},
	Set{value: T}
}
// And then:
enum State:Full<T, Final> {
	...State:Effect<T>,
	Final{value: Final},
}

// Handle! Does it actually return a value? How would it?
let rec loop = (current, fn) => {
	switch handle!(fn) {
		State:Effect::Get => resume!(current),
		State:Effect::Set{value} => loop(value, () => resume!()),
		State:Full::Final{value} => value,
	}
}

// Alternatively, I could just do
handle! fn {
	State:Effect::Get => resume!(current),
	State:Effect::Set{value} => loop(value, () => resume!()),
	State:Full::Final{value} => value,
}
// which would still allow me to reuse switch syntax for the most part.
```

resuming must happen in the body of the switch



Btw we're going to use `{* x *}` instead of `{x}`, to avoid collisions with records,
and to allow separation off EffLambda and EffApply.

Ok while I'm in the 'thinking about weird things' mood,
do we have any solution for 'effects are special and weird'?

```ts
effect State<T> {
	Get{} => T,
	Set{value: T} => (),
}
// -> produces (essentially? Maybe literally?)
enum State<T> {
	Get{},
	Set{value: T}
}
// and I mean do we just have a rule that you
// can't have a `k`? No, I think we just make it k_ or something.
enum StateCatch<T, Final> {
	Get{k: (value: int) => Final},
	Set{value: int, k: () => Final},
	End{value: Final}, // right?? maybe???
}
// And then you can later
raise!(State<int>::Get)
raise!(State<int>::Set{:10})
// now, if you try to raise an enum that wasn't created
// with ... ... .. . .. ... .... . .. .... .. .... . . .. ...
// hmm maybe that's misleading.
// because you can't do something like. ...
(eff: State<int>) => raise!(eff)
// because we wouldn't know the return value.
// I mean I guess technically we mighttt be able to if all of them were the same
// but that seems very weird.
// Really, I want the type of `eff` to have information on it of what the result
// of the raise is. But we don't.
// So, you're stuck with producing any effect enums that you wan't to raise,
// right at the moment you raise them.

// this might make some sense.

let rec loop = (current, fn) => {
	switch handle!(fn) {
		Get{k} => k(current),
		Set{value, k} => loop(value, k),
		End{value} => value,
	}
}
```

idk if it could actually be realized
from a computational flow sense.
or whether it's even accurate type-wise.
but it's cool to think about.
