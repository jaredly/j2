So I'm wondering if I'm actually getting all that much out of my hash addressed business.

Things I'm getting:
- multiple dispatch without any ambiguity
	ok yeah that is quite nice to have
- indelible track record of everything you've done
	- yeah this is a big deal. Change an implementation without
		having to worry about the places it's being used.
- incremental building for free99
	- at least up until monomorphization

Things I'm paying:
- updating dependencies is like a whole thing

hm ok maybe I'll stick with it for now.
