# Nore (new-core) Roadmap

### Structured Features

- [x] basic atom edit
- [x] click a paren, select something close to it
	- [ ] setSelection should go into selection, I think? ... 
- [x] backspace to remove ... an arg
- [x] if no args, remove the callExpression
- [ ] backspace to remove a suffix? idk
- [x] clicking the left / right side of a `(` should do the expected
- [x] simplify AtomEditor

- [x] ooh ooh BUG
	If I click into something else, it removes selection from the thing I was
	editing, which gets unmounted, and then ... we lose that info.
	- yay fixed

- [x] so, thinking about blanks. obs with an arg ... that's not the sole arg,
	we want to leave it as a blank.
	but if it's the only arg, I think we ditch it.
- [x] allow selection into the "interior" of a thing. like at: 'inner'

- [ ] CallSuffix end _ backspace should remove
- [ ] CallSuffix inner + backspace hsould remove
- [ ] selecting the start of an apply should ... select the start of the target.

- [ ] do live updates for atomedit indicating parseability
	- hmm do I actually need this? hmm

- [ ] drag to select ... I'll do the thing like I do, for drag & drop;
	- have a central registry of all dom nodes
	- gotta make sure to prune it folks
	- on drag start, calculate relevant points
		- use start & current mousepos to figure out the proper selection

- [ ] ahhhhh ok so I do in fact have to stop editing things in-place, so that I
	can do an undo stack.
	yeah that makes sense.




## Structured Editor

- [x] loc's need an `idx`
- [x] gen type for locs
- [x] need to gen types w/ indirection.
	- so anywhere there's a "ref", we go with `number` which is an idx
- [x] handwrite a transformer from the straight tree to the indirect one? and back I assume? ðŸ¤”
	- or do I just want to go whole hog on the indirect version?
		I mean when I do a hash, I probably don't want to be involving the random idxs.
		so yeah I probably do want to be able to convert back.
		Also, for general tree manipulation, and like codegen and stuff, I probably want a straight tree?
- [x] try a structured editor with the mapified version!
	- central store, with
	- the map of idx -> stuff
	- listeners for when a stuff changes
	- the current state of selection ðŸ¤”
		- how do I define selection? like ... hm
			or maybe the state of selection lives in the DOM?


### Laters

- [ ] autogen the to-map dealio, it's fine to be handwritten for the moment tho

## Getting something all the way I think

ident-const-apply

- [x] gram definitions
- [x] gram->ts
- [x] gram->peg
- [ ] gram->structured editor???????

LATER I think I'll do AST->infer->AST
- [ ] (peg->infer)
	- oh so maybe I can do inference? like maybe I can ...
		just need to wrangle myself a global ctx...
