# Nore (new-core) Roadmap

Highlevel things I haven't solved at all:
- pretty-printingggg
	so, breaking long lines.


### Structured Features

#### First Step: basic editing, navigation, and selection

##### Editing Stuff

- [x] # Identifiers
- [x] # Numbers
- [ ] # Apply/CallSuffixes

- [ ] binops probably??
- [ ] lambdas, which means patterns, yaknow


- [x] basic atom edit
- [x] click a paren, select something close to it
	- [ ] setSelection should go into selection, I think? ... 
- [x] backspace to remove ... an arg
- [x] if no args, remove the callExpression
- [x] clicking the left / right side of a `(` should do the expected
- [x] simplify AtomEditor

- [x] ooh ooh BUG
	If I click into something else, it removes selection from the thing I was
	editing, which gets unmounted, and then ... we lose that info.
	- yay fixed

- [x] so, thinking about blanks. obs with an arg ... that's not the sole arg,
	we want to leave it as a blank.
	but if it's the only arg, I think we ditch it.
- [x] allow selection into the "interior" of a thing. like at: 'inner'

- [x] ',' comma to add an argggg
	- [x] fix double-remove
- [x] CallSuffix end _ backspace should remove
	- oooh OK so, backspace should switch it to `select:edit,at:change`
	- and then another backspace removes it. yeah that makes a lot of sense.
- [x] better suffix backspace
- [x] CallSuffix inner + backspace hsould remove
- [x] ')' in an arg should select the end of the CallExpr
- [x] selecting the start of an apply should ... select the start of the target.

- [x] ARROW KEYSSS
	- so, navigating ,right?
	- got it good

- [x] selection?? should I do vim mode? or not yet?
	- [x] not yet on the vim mode
	- [x] collect boxes for nodes
	- [x] do a lowest common parent
	- [x] figure out how to allow selecting multiple children

- [ ] do live updates for atomedit indicating parseability
	- hmm do I actually need this? hmm

- [x] drag to select ... I'll do the thing like I do, for drag & drop;
	- have a central registry of all dom nodes
	- gotta make sure to prune it folks
	- on drag start, calculate relevant points
		- use start & current mousepos to figure out the proper selection

- [ ] ahhhhh ok so I do in fact have to stop editing things in-place, so that I
	can do an undo stack.
	yeah that makes sense.
	- [ ] um command pattern? maybe? idk probably.
		- "Replace node"
		- "Delete node"

BEFORE I get too far, let's make sure UNDO/REDO is a thing

OHHHKKKK I guess I want a central command pattern. fine.
then I can just pop any modified map nodes into an object, along with the current selection state.
that'll be nice.

#### Second Step: IDE features, autocomplete, etc.

- [ ] autocomplete an identifier
- [ ] when producing a `CallSuffix`, if the type of the thing is known, go ahead and populate `Blank`s for each expected argument. Would be great if the blanks knew their desired type, and even label if applicable.



## Structured Editor

- [x] loc's need an `idx`
- [x] gen type for locs
- [x] need to gen types w/ indirection.
	- so anywhere there's a "ref", we go with `number` which is an idx
- [x] handwrite a transformer from the straight tree to the indirect one? and back I assume? ðŸ¤”
	- or do I just want to go whole hog on the indirect version?
		I mean when I do a hash, I probably don't want to be involving the random idxs.
		so yeah I probably do want to be able to convert back.
		Also, for general tree manipulation, and like codegen and stuff, I probably want a straight tree?
- [x] try a structured editor with the mapified version!
	- central store, with
	- the map of idx -> stuff
	- listeners for when a stuff changes
	- the current state of selection ðŸ¤”
		- how do I define selection? like ... hm
			or maybe the state of selection lives in the DOM?


### Laters

- [ ] autogen the to-map dealio, it's fine to be handwritten for the moment tho

## Getting something all the way I think

ident-const-apply

- [x] gram definitions
- [x] gram->ts
- [x] gram->peg
- [ ] gram->structured editor???????

LATER I think I'll do AST->infer->AST
- [ ] (peg->infer)
	- oh so maybe I can do inference? like maybe I can ...
		just need to wrangle myself a global ctx...
